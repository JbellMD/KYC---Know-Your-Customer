# KYC---Know-Your-Customer

# At AnyCompany Bank, I have completed the task of building the new onboarding application on AWS. The application is named Know Your Customer (KYC). 
# This application feature intakes a users selfie and government ID and uses AWS microservices to automate the task of onboarding new customers and verifying their information. This feature consists of three Lambda functions; document, license submission, and license validation, one S3 bucket for file hosting, AWS Rekognition and AWS Textract for cross checking information automatically, DynamoDB table for data storage, and AWS SQS and SNS for API event driven workflow.
